# Divorce-Rates-Using-Statistical-and-Regression-Analysis
This project with Python looks at the highest causes of divorce using summary 
statistics, histograms, PMF, CDF, a normal probability plot, scatterplots, correlation 
tests, and simple linear regression. It can help couples going to marriage counseling
with the insights this provides or fiances that want to better their relationship.  
Marriage is statistically less likely to succeed than divorce, so it is important to 
be informed before committing to a marriage.
